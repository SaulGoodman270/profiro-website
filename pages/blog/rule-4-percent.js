        <h1>The 4% Rule: Your Ticket to Financial Freedom</h1>
        <p><em>Published: October 20, 2025</em></p>

        <p>
          Imagine waking up every morning knowing you never have to work for money again — not
          because you won the lottery, but because your investments generate enough passive income
          to cover all your living expenses. That’s <strong>financial independence</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          But how much do you actually need to reach that point? There’s a simple, time-tested
          principle that gives you the answer.
        </p>

        <h2>🎯 What Is the 4% Rule?</h2>
        <p>
          The 4% Rule suggests that you can safely withdraw <strong>4%</strong> of your investment
          portfolio each year — with a very high probability that your money will last for the rest
          of your life.
        </p>

        <h2>🔢 How It Helps: Find Your “Freedom Number”</h2>
        <p>
          The beauty of this rule lies in its simplicity. You can easily reverse it to calculate
          how much you’ll need to reach financial independence.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>How much do you spend annually?</strong> Multiply that amount by <strong>25</strong> (because 1 / 0.04 = 25).
        </p>

        <h2>Example</h2>
        <p>
          Suppose you want to live on $40,000 per year. Multiply by 25 → you’ll need a portfolio of{" "}
          <strong>$1,000,000</strong> to retire safely.
        </p>

        <h2>🤔 Any Caveats?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Not a law of physics:</strong> it’s based on historical data — future returns may vary.</li>
          <li><strong>Inflation matters:</strong> the rule assumes you adjust withdrawals each year.</li>
          <li><strong>Taxes count:</strong> your after-tax income may differ from projections.</li>
        </ul>
